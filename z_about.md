	<h1>Hi, I'm Liz!</h1>

	<p>I'm an Austin-based UI Designer with a background in psychology and research. I'm a maker and a doer with a desire to solve problems and create great online experiences.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Aiken, SC and went to college in Charleston, SC. I moved to Austin, TX in 2014 with my pup, Dexter, in tow. It's been such a whirlwind experience so far. I can't get enough of the music scene and eating too many tacos for my own good.</p>

	<p>Things I'm into include hiking adventures, dog cuddles and kisses, festivals, and yoga.</p>
