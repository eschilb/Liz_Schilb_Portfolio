		<h3>The Project</h3>
		<p>Popover is the final project that I worked on at The Iron Yard. It's a web application that I researched, designed, and coded over the course of two weeks. The idea for Popover came from the food scene and pre-existing dinner clubs in Austin, TX. There's a shortage of dinner clubs that are affordable for anyone who wants to share in this communal experience but not foot a hefty bill. Foodies get together for a dining experience, and instead of going to a restaurant they are hosted at someone's house. Each experience is unique, and hosts can decide what they'll serve and provide any details that they want when they create their own event. Guests can browse through all upcoming events, and see the details of any events that interest them. I aimed to accomplish all of this within one app.</p>

		<h3>The Process</h3>
		<h4>Design Research</h4>
		<p>First, I decided what research needed to be done to get started. I wrote a wordlist to get out all of the ideas that I could and to get an idea of some possible directions that I could take. Then, I created a user survey to get an idea of diner's habits and what is important to them when attending a dinner party. Once I received responses, I took a look at my results and wrote out notes about what was or was not important for those surveyed and what features were important to include/make obvious and what features were less important to have. I also wrote out user personas for two types of users: those who are going onto the app to host an event and those using the app to attend an event. Lastly, I created user flows for these two users. These last two informed what pages I should focus on when creating the pages.</p>
		<h4>Design Concepts</h4>
		<p>I moved on to concepts for my design. Because eating and parties engage so many of the senses, I wanted to be remniscent of that as much as possible in the design. Out of the style tiles that I created, I chose one with the colors and elements that reminds the user of an outdoor party </p>
