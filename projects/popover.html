		<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>

		<p>Popover is the final project that I worked on at The Iron Yard. It's a web application that I researched, designed, and coded over the course of two weeks. The idea for Popover came from the food scene and dinner clubs in Austin, TX. There's a shortage of dinner clubs for anyone who wants to share in this communal experience but not foot a hefty bill. Foodies get together for a dining experience, and instead of going to a restaurant they are hosted at someone's house. Each experience is unique, and hosts can decide what they'll serve and provide any details that they want when they create their own event. Guests can browse through all upcoming events, and see the details of any events that interest them. I aimed to accomplish all of this within one app.</p>

		<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>

		<h4>Design Research</h4>

		<p>To kickoff research, I wrote a wordlist to get out all of the ideas that I could and get an idea of some possible directions that I could take. Then, I created a user survey to collect information about diner's habits and what is important to them when attending a dinner party. I used the responses to inform what features were important to include. I created user personas for two types of users: those who are going onto the app to host an event and those using the app to attend an event. Lastly, I created user flows based on these two users.</p>

		<h4>Design Concepts</h4>

		<p>For the concept for the design, I wanted to be reminiscent of all of the senses engaged at parties as much as possible in the design. I created style tiles in Adobe Illustrator, and I chose one with the color palette and elements inspired by an outdoor party with lush greenery. I made sketches, wireframes, and mockups, keeping the users in mind to create an ideal experience for them.</p>

		<p>I created a logo and icons for the site using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to incorporate the shape of a popover into the logo. I incorporated elements from the popover shape into the lettering of the logo. Here are some examples. </p>

		<h4>Technical</h4>

		<p>I coded from scratch with HTML and Sass and used CSS and jQuery for my animations. I used Bourbon, Neat, and Refills to create the navigation for all pages and tabs for the events page.</p>
