		<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>

		<p>Shelter Mobile is a mobile application prototype that I created with two other designers. A design alumni from The Iron Yard was our "client" and gave us the details for our project. Our task was to make a platform for foster parents to arrange rides to and from adoptions events and clinic visits.</p>

		<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>

		<h4>Design Research</h4>

		<p>To kickoff research, I wrote a wordlist to get out all of the ideas that I could and get an idea of some possible directions that I could take. Then, I created a user survey to collect information about diner's habits and what is important to them when attending a dinner party. I used the responses to inform what features were important to include. I created user personas for two types of users: those who are going onto the app to host an event and those using the app to attend an event. Lastly, I created user flows based on these two users.</p>

		<h4>Design Concepts</h4>

		<p>For the concept for the design, I wanted to be reminiscent of all of the senses engaged at parties as much as possible in the design. I created style tiles in Adobe Illustrator, and I chose one with the color palette and elements inspired by an outdoor party with lush greenery. </p>

		<p>I created a logo and icons for the site using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to incorporate the shape of a popover into the logo. I incorporated elements from the popover shape into the shape of each letter. The "o" and "e" shape comes from the top puff on the popover and the "p" shape comes from the side puff. Here are some of the examples. </p>

		<h4>Technical</h4>

		<p>I coded from scratch with HTML and Sass and used CSS and jQuery for my animations. I used Bourbon, Neat, and Refills to create the navigation for all pages and tabs for the events page.</p>
