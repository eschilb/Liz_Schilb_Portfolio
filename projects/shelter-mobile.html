		<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>

		<p>Shelter Mobile is a mobile application prototype that I created with two other designers. A design alumni from The Iron Yard was our "client" and gave us the details for our project. Our task was to make a platform for foster parents to arrange rides to and from adoption events and clinic visits.</p>

		<p>With the app, foster parents can organize rides for their foster pets for adoption events as well as clinic appointments and unplanned clinic visits. Volunteers can sign up to give rides to fostered pets and see the details in one place. It was important to make the app easy to use and to make the tone positive and friendly so that volunteers and foster parents are excited to use the app.</p>

		<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>

		<h4>Design Research</h4>

		<p>Our team split up the design research which included a wordlist, user personas, user scenarios, site inspirations, and user flows. The planning phase included collaboration with the team to talk through our ideas and to decide on the direction together.</p>

		<h4>Design Concepts</h4>

		<p>We created style tiles, sketches, and wireframes before mocking up the pages for our prototype. The style tile that we chose had design elements we wanted to use as well as the color palette and typography. We created the mockups and loaded them into InVision to prototype.</p>
