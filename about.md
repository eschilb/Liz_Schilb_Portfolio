<h1>Hi, I'm Liz!</h1>

<p>I grew up in Aiken, SC and received my BS in Psychology from The College of Charleston in Charleston, SC. I worked for a startup in Charleston, SC as a Research Analyst but after a while I had my sights set on moving to a new city. Austin seemed like a good fit for my lifestyle and aspirations.</p>

<p>I moved to Austin, TX in February of 2014 and I have fallen in love with the city. The food is amazing and I have access to amazing music festivals and music venues. The only missing piece is to find a job doing what I'm passionate about. I wanted to be proactive in that process so I've quit my day job to do the UI Design program at The Iron Yard. It's a 12 week program that's been a whirlwind so far. I can't wait to see what comes next!</p>
