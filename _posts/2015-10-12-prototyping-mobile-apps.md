This past week was a group project to research, design, and prototype a mobile app for clients. 

We split into teams and my team consisted or two other designers. Our client is an alumni designer from the first UI Design cohort at The Iron Yard - Austin. She presented us with our task to design a mobile app for an Austin animal shelter to connect volunteers at the shelter with foster parents that need their foster dog or cat transported to the clinic for visits or transported to an adoption event. We asked her questions to get a feel for what she would like to see in the app. 

The first step was to use Trello to create cards which were essentially each task that needed to be completed with an estimate for how much time that it would take to complete. Then we created a daily sprint (what we would do for that night) based on our estimates. 

Someone from my team created a word list, a list of all the associations to the pet transport app and then branch off into more associations with that association. The point is to get beyond the obvious words like "adoption" or "car" and to explore themes that in some way relate to the app but are not the first thing that you would think of. He wrote down words that related to the adventurous side of what is going on. From the perspective of a dog, each outing is exciting and fun and we wanted to capture those kind of emotions to keep the app upbeat. When you think about it, adoption can be a gloomy subject. Pets sometimes come from bad situation and can know suffering. Pet shelters and fostering offers them hope where there may have been a void before. You want to get across that this is a new life and that everyone involved  and the users of the app get that feeling that they are making a positive difference with each interaction that they have with the application.

I made user personas and user scenarios based on the main users of the site. Our target audiences were the volunteers at the shelter, the foster parents, and the shelter. Another person on my team found inspiration apps that we could use when designing our app.

The second daily sprint, we worked through user flows to decide how the volunteer and the foster parent would be navigating through the app. I created style tiles while the other members of the team sketched out pages for the app. Our third sprint we solidified a style tile as our deliverable and created wireframes. Our fourth sprint, we worked on a mockup page as a group to so that the ones we would do on our own would be relatively consistent. I got a lot out of seeing the thought process that my fellow designers went through while creating mockups. Once I finished my mockups, another member of the team compared our pages to check for consistency. We loaded those pages into Invision and created hotspots to show how the user might interact with each page.

Our client gave us feedback on the design and we were able to rework all of our pages and reload them into Invision. My main takeaway from this process is that I love prototyping! There's so much we could have done but designing the entire app we could really focus on the main interactions while prototyping. Still, it's exciting to think about how many little things that you can play around with and test using prototypes. I look forward to any experience where I can go through prototyping again. If I could do this all over again, it would be to get to the point of prototyping sooner so that we could test, fix, test again, and hopefully come out at the other end with a strong app.

My boyfriend, Will, is still on his trip to India. The first week was spent at the orphanage where they implemented a brand new robotics program. It went so well and all of the kids were super excited. One of the people he is travelling with wrote about his experience. He wrote that the kids were split into groups and some kids from groups that were scheduled for later sessions would try to sneak in to an earlier group. Some kids would try to get into later groups so that they could take the class twice. They are so excited to learn what the engineers came there to teach them. Will described his experiences in the web chats that we had and he's felt the impact that he's making. The kids get attached and when it's time to go they call him "brother" or tell him that they love him. I would lose it if I had to look at a child that knows what it is to lose their parents or to be taken out of their home, feel love for them and then have to say goodbye. 

Now he's on a self funded tour through India with some of the crew that was at the orphanage. They've already visited places like the Taj Mahal and are touring Darjeeling. Even from far away, he's good at creating great moments for us to enjoy. I woke up this morning and he sent me an amazing picture of a mountainview at a botanical garden and said he wished we could enjoy it together.
