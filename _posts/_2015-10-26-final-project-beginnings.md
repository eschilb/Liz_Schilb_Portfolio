Catching up on the news from last few weeks. 

We've had so much happen so I'll touch on some highlights. We got to design and code our portfolios and we also designed logos and personal logos. This was my first time working with a Jekyll site. 

Our class got advice from a branding expert and we got advice on how to brand ourselves, and how to talk about ourselves in a cover letter and how to self promote.

During our last week of classes, we worked on creating style guides. The goal of our style guide is to have a living guide for developers to maintain consistency on the site.

We also learned how to style Google Maps for a website.

We began brainstorming for our final projects and pitched our project ideas in class. This past weekend I created a GitHub repository, planned out an schedule for our final project, and made personal goals for the final project.
